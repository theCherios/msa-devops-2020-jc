Description:
Build and release a pipeline to be used for a react app.
This Build and release pipeline is linked to my github account updates. When pushed to commit, the master the pipeline will run. 
It also allows me to pre-install tools for project, which in this project was node.js.
Automated tests are also run after each release to ensure my code is functional
The react web app uses the release pipeline to deploy the web app via azure services.
